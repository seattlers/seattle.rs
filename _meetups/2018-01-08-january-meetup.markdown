NOTE: We're back at our usual location (Ada's) this month!

This month: Joe Ranweiler will present the progress on his statistics and benchmarking tooling, with free time afterwards for socializing.

We'll be at [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org) HQ.

### To get in:
The building is called the Financial Center, and has a large revolving door as its entrance. The building requires a keycard to even use the elevator, so we will have a runner to let people in.
