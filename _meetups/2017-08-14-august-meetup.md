This month we have a talk on first steps using Rust with the Raspberry Pi platform!

Abstract:
>>> Brad Gibson is working to build electric cars from scratch using Rust. He will walk the group through his experience of being new to Rust and overcoming a number of challenges to successfully achieve his very first step: to use Rust to light an LED wired to a Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian (Linux for Raspberry Pi).

We'll be at [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org) HQ.

### To get in:
The building is called the Financial Center, and has a large revolving door as its entrance. The building requires a keycard to even use the elevator, so we will have a runner to let people in.
