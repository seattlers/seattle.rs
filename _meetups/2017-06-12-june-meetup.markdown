This month at Seattle.rs:

[Nathan](https://github.com/cessen) will lead a guided group coding session to write a simple memory arena in a Rust!

We'll be at [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org) HQ.

### To get in:
The building is called the Financial Center, and has a large revolving door as its entrance. The building requires a keycard to even use the elevator, so we will have a runner to let people in.
