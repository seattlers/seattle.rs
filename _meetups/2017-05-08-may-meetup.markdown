This month at Seattle.rs:

[Without Boats](https://github.com/withoutboats), a Rust Language Design Team member, will be giving a talk about Rust's 2017 Language Roadmap and Ergonomics Initiative.

We'll be at [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org) HQ.

### To get in:
The building is called the Financial Center, and has a large revolving door as its entrance. The building requires a keycard to even use the elevator, so we will have a runner to let people in.
