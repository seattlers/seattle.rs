This month: UPDATE: It turns out that our previously-scheduled speaker won't be able to join us on Monday. Instead, we'll have an open hack night. Bring laptop and a project to work on if you like, or just come on down to chat about Rust. Sorry for the unexpected change of plans!

We'll be at [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org) HQ.

### To get in:
The building is called the Financial Center, and has a large revolving door as its entrance. The building requires a keycard to even use the elevator, so we will have a runner to let people in.
