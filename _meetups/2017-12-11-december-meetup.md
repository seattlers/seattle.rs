This month Qumulo will be hosting us with pizza and beer included!

Remi from Qumulo will be giving a talk titled: "Integrating Rust into Qumulo's C Testing Framework".

We'll be at [Qumulo](https://goo.gl/maps/Jx2BvcmfqLk) HQ.

Qumulo is located at 1501 4th Ave #1600, Seattle, WA 98101.

**To get in:**

You should enter the building from 4th Avenue. The main entrance on that side is on 4th between Pine and Pike (right by Yardhouse). Take the escalators up and the first bank of elevators on your left to the 16th floor. We will have signs and folks helping usher in visitors as well.
