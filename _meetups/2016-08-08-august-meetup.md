This month, Chris Giffing will be giving a talk on concurrency in Rust.

Abstract: Channels were originally a core part of Rust. Through significant effort they removed it from the core and now concurrency is something for libraries to worry about. Because of this language design decision, the amount of choices for handling concurrent operations in Rust can be daunting. Let's go on a journey that starts with the standard library and ends with a look at a few third-party libraries.

There will also be time afterward for lightning talks, so feel free to prep something!
