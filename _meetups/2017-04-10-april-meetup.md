This month at Seattle.rs:

- [Jameson Ernst](https://github.com/jpernst) will be giving a talk on the problem of self-borrowing structs, and his crate [Rental](https://github.com/jpernst/rental), which helps solve that problem!
- Lightning talks from the community.

We'll be at [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org) HQ.

### To get in:
The building is called the Financial Center, and has a large revolving door as its entrance. The building requires a keycard to even use the elevator, so we will have a runner to let people in.
